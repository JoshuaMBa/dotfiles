**Dotfiles**

My dotfiles setup. Run `git clone https://github.com/JoshuaMBa/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source scripts/setup.sh` to setup up dotfiles. Run `git pull && source scripts/update.sh` to fetch and apply updates. Note that you may still need to make changes so that `tmux` can be found through your $PATH. Currently I've added support for `tmux` on MacOS in `.commonrc`.
